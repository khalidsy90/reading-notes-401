#Access Control (ACL)

![acl](https://www.imperva.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2020/02/access-control-list.jpg)

**Review, Research, and Discussion**

**When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?**

Use basic to access API directly with username and password
Bearer is more secure and requires two calls, one to get a token and one to get the data - bearer is preferred because of the extra security

**What does the JSON Web Token package do?**

allows you to use JSON Web Tokens to securely transfer data between two parties as JSON objects

**What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?**

a secret should be secure
secrets should be encrypted
secret should be visually different from id
Document the following Vocabulary Terms

---

**encryption:**
cryptographically turns data into a secret code that cannot easily be deciphered

**token:**
a token is a thing that represents an object

**bearer:**
a type of token used for authentication - represents the user

**secret:**
a secret ket or passcode used to login or create a login/token

**JSON Web Token:**
JSON web tokens are used to securely transmit data between parties as JSON objects
